<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.15.x+to+0.16.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.15.x to 0.16.x</h2>

<p>First there are additional dependencies you will need, which on Ubuntu
12.04 can be installed with:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install poppler-utils libreoffice</pre>

<p>On Ubuntu 10.04:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install poppler-utils openoffice.org openoffice.org-java-common</pre>

<p>Libre Office is a background service which is called by convert_office
plugin, to convert some document types (ms office documents, open office
documents, etc.) into pdf document.</p>

<p>The command to start libre office in headless mode and as the background
process:</p>

<pre>nohup soffice --headless --accept=&quot;socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;&quot; --nofirststartwizard &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>

<p>If you run on production server, using apache and phusion passenger, you
will need to run the Libre Office service under www-data user. To do this
it will need to create a working directory in /var/www. The name of the
directory changes between versions, but will be called something similar to
libreoffice or .openoffice.org2. The easiest way to create this directory
is to make a note of the permissions for /var/www, then make it writable to
www-data, start the service, and then put the permissions on /var/www back
to what they were originally.</p>

<pre>sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www</pre>

<p>Then to start the service manually you use:</p>

<pre>nohup sudo -H -u www-data soffice --headless --accept=&quot;socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;&quot; --nofirststartwizard &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>

<p>The 8100 port is used by default, if you&#39;d like to run on another port,
you need also to synchronize the changed port with the default soffice_port
setting for convert_office plugin in config/environment.rb</p>

<p>We recommend the Libre Office service is setup using an init.d script,
following the same procedures for delayed job using the script found at: <a
href="https://gist.github.com/3787679">gist.github.com/3787679</a></p>

<p>If you have problem with converting speed, you should upgrade OS to Ubuntu
12.04 to use Libre Office. Or you can install libre office 3.5 from PPA,
but there could be problems later on when upgrading OS. Here are the
command to install libre office from PPA:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get purge openoffice* libreoffice*
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-3-5
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libreoffice</pre>

<p>Other than this, the remaining steps are the same standard steps are
previous versions:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.16.3
hg update
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.14.x+to+0.15.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.14.x to 0.15.x</h2>

<p>SEEK 0.15 upgraded Rails to the latest 2 version,2.3.14. This requires an
update of Rubygems to 1.6.2. You can update rubygems directly by running</p>

<pre>gem update --system 1.6.2</pre>

<p>or install from scratch by reading the <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a>
guide. You can also use <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>. SEEK 0.15 also
runs fine on the latest Rubygems (currently 1.8.24) but you will get some
deprecation warnings. You can check you have the correct version of
rubygems by running</p>

<pre>gem -v</pre>

<p>Then you will need to install additional dependency:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install git</pre>

<p>Once Rubygems has been updated and additional dependency has been
installed, the upgrade is the typical:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.15.4
hg update
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.13.x+to+0.14.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.13.x to 0.14.x</h2>

<p>These are the fairly standard steps when upgrading between minor versions.
Note, the seek:upgrade task can take a while if there are many people and
assets in your SEEK, as it needs to populate some tables for the default
subscriptions (for email notifications).</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.14.1
hg update
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start
touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.11.x+to+0.13.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.11.x to 0.13.x</h2>

<p>There follows the commands required to upgrade. Anything after # are notes
and do not need to be included in the command run. There are a few
additional steps for this upgrade due to the switch from Solr to Sunspot as
the search system, and the introduction of Delayed Job for background
processing.</p>

<p>First there is an additional dependency you will need, which on Ubuntu
10.04 or Debian can be installed with:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev</pre>

<p>on Ubuntu 12.04 this will be:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev</pre>

<p>then the following steps will update the SEEK server:</p>

<pre>bundle exec rake solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production # this is specific to this upgrade, since the command to stop and start the search has changed.
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.13.3
hg update
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex RAILS_ENV=production  # to reindex
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production</pre>

<p>SEEK v0.13.x now uses a Ruby tool called <a
href="https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a> to handle
background processing which now needs to be started using:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start</pre>

<p>And now SEEK should be ready to restart. If running together with Passenger
Phusion as described in the install guide this is simply a case of:</p>

<pre>touch tmp/restart.txt</pre>

<p>If you auto start solr with an init.d/ script - this will need updating to
reflect the change to sunspot:solr:start. The updated script should look
something like: <a
href="https://gist.github.com/3143434">gist.github.com/3143434</a></p>
