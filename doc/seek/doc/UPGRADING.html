<h1 id="label-Upgrading+SEEK">Upgrading SEEK</h1>

<p>If you have an existing SEEK installation, and you haven&#39;t done so
already, please take a moment to fill out our very short,optional <a
href="http://www.sysmo-db.org/seek-registration">SEEK Registration
Form</a>. Doing so will be very useful to us in the future when we try and
raise further funding to develop and support SEEK and the associated tools.</p>

<p><strong>Always backup your SEEK data before starting to upgrade!!</strong>
- see the <a href="BACKUPS.html">Backup Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the <a
href="INSTALL.html">Installation Guide</a> guide. It assumes it is a
production server that is being updated, and that commands are run from the
root directory of the SEEK application.</p>

<p>If your current installation is not linked to to the SEEK BitBucket
Mercurial repository, it can still easily be updated by taking the next
stable tag, reconfiguring the database configuration to point at your
existing database, and copying across the <em>filestore/</em> directory.
The upgrade steps can then be followed, with the Mercurial (hg) steps
omitted.</p>

<h2 id="label-Identifying+your+version">Identifying your version</h2>

<p>The version of SEEK you are running is shown at the bottom left, within the
footer, when viewing pages in SEEK.</p>

<p>You can also tell which version you have installed by looking at the
<em>config/version.yml</em> file, so for example version 0.13.2 looks
something like:</p>

<pre>major: 0
minor: 13
patch: 2</pre>

<h2 id="label-General+notes+about+versions+and+upgrading">General notes about versions and upgrading</h2>

<p><strong>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact
us.</strong> You can find details on how to contact us at: <a
href="http://seek4science.org/contact">seek4science.org/contact</a></p>

<p>When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to
each released minor version in order incrementally (i.e. 0.13.x -&gt;
0.14.x -&gt; 0.15.x -&gt; 0.16.x, you can skip patch versions such as
0.13.3).</p>

<p>Each version has a tag in mercurial, which has the format of <em>v</em>
prefix followed by the version - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.2, v0.17.1</p>

<p><strong>When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to
0.13.x)</strong> it is necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform
upgrade changes and import any new data. The upgrade task may require an
internet connection, and sometimes can take some time to run, so please be
patient. There are instructions for upgrading between each minor version
listed below, but they will generally follow the same pattern. Upgrading to
version 0.18 is an exception and involves some additional steps - due to
the upgrade of the required versions of Rails and Ruby.</p>

<p><strong>When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.16.0 and
0.16.3)</strong> it should only be necessary to run <em>bundle install</em>
and the <em>db:migrate</em> rake task. Using seek:upgrade should still
work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time. There is more details and
an example towards the end of the this page.</p>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.20.x+to+0.21.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.20.x to 0.21.x</h2>

<pre>export RAILS_ENV=production # if upgrading a production server - remember to set this again if closing and reopening the shell

bundle exec ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop</pre>

<p>if using rvm do:</p>

<pre>rvm get stable
rvm install ruby-2.1.3</pre>

<p>then:</p>

<pre>hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.21.0
hg update # only if no other changes have been made to your local version, if you get an error ignore it and do merge
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have, you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
cd .. &amp;&amp; cd seek #this is to allow RVM to pick up the ruby and gemset changes
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade</pre>

<p>The mechanism to start, stop and restart the delayed-job process has now
changed you you should use the rake task
seek:workers:&lt;start|stop|restart|status&gt;, e.g</p>

<pre>bundle exec rake seek:workers:start</pre>

<p>there is a new init.d script for this described at <a
href="https://gist.github.com/e4219ec7cb161129f1c7">gist.github.com/e4219ec7cb161129f1c7</a></p>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.19.x+to+0.20.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.19.x to 0.20.x</h2>

<p>Start the upgrade following the standard steps:</p>

<pre>#if using rvm do:
rvm get stable
rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p545

export RAILS_ENV=production # if upgrading a production server - remember to set this again if closing and reopening the shell

./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.20.0
hg update # only if no other changes have been made to your local version, if you get an error ignore it and do merge
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have, you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade</pre>

<p>If you are upgrading a production server, you also need to run the
following task. Be patient, as this can take a few minutes</p>

<pre>bundle exec rake assets:precompile</pre>

<p>Now proceed with the rest of the usual tasks:</p>

<pre>bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start # to restart the search server
./script/delayed_job start

touch tmp/restart.txt
bundle exec rake tmp:clear</pre>

<p>If you are running through Apache, you should also add the following block
to your Apache configuration, after the Directory block:</p>

<pre>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/assets/.*$&quot;&gt;
         Header unset ETag
         FileETag None
         # RFC says only cache for 1 year
         ExpiresActive On
         ExpiresDefault &quot;access plus 1 year&quot;
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;</pre>

<p>so it will look something like:</p>

<pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
     ServerName www.yourhost.com
     DocumentRoot /srv/rails/seek/public
        &lt;Directory /srv/rails/seek/public&gt;
         AllowOverride all
         Options -MultiViews
      &lt;/Directory&gt;
      &lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/assets/.*$&quot;&gt;
         Header unset ETag
         FileETag None
         # RFC says only cache for 1 year
         ExpiresActive On
         ExpiresDefault &quot;access plus 1 year&quot;
      &lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>

<p>You may also need to enable a couple of Apache modules, so run:</p>

<pre>sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod expires</pre>

<p>You will then need to restart Apache</p>

<pre>sudo service apache2 restart</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.18.x+to+0.19.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.18.x to 0.19.x</h2>

<p>Upgrading follows the standard steps:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.19.1
hg update
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

touch tmp/restart.txt
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.17.x+to+0.18.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.17.x to 0.18.x</h2>

<p>The changes for Version 0.18 included upgrading Ruby to version 1.9.3 and
Rails to version 3.2 - this means the upgrade process is a little bit more
involved that usual. For this reason we have a seperate page detailing this
upgrade.</p>

<p>Please visit <a href="UPGRADING-TO-0-18.html">Upgrading to 0.18</a> for
details of how to do this upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.16.x+to+0.17.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.16.x to 0.17.x</h2>

<p>Upgrading follows the standard steps:</p>

<pre>RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.17.1
hg update
hg merge # only required if you&#39;ve made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production

bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

touch tmp/restart.txt
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production</pre>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+between+patches+%28e.g.+between+0.16.0+to+0.16.3%29">Steps to upgrade between patches (e.g. between 0.16.0 to 0.16.3)</h2>

<p>This example shows upgrading from v0.16.0, v0.16.1, or v0.16.2 to v0.16.3
as an example, but the process is the same for upgrading between patch
versions unless otherwise stated. You can upgrade directly from one patch
version to another, skipping the intermediate versions (so you can upgrade
directly 0.16.0 to 0.16.3 without first having to upgrade to 0.16.1)</p>

<pre>hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.16.3
hg update
hg merge # if necessary
hg commit -m &quot;merged&quot; # if necessary
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

touch tmp/restart.txt
bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production</pre>

<h2 id="label-Earlier+upgrade+notes">Earlier upgrade notes</h2>
