= Upgrading SEEK

If you have an existing SEEK installation, and you haven't done so already, please take a moment to fill out our very short,optional {SEEK Registration Form}[http://www.sysmo-db.org/seek-registration].
Doing so will be very useful to us in the future when we try and raise further funding to develop and support SEEK and the associated tools.

<b>Always backup your SEEK data before starting to upgrade!!</b> - see the {Backup Guide}[link:doc/BACKUPS.html].

This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the {Installation Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL.html] guide. It assumes it is
a production server that is being updated, and that commands are run from the root directory of the SEEK application.

If your current installation is not linked to to the SEEK BitBucket Mercurial repository, it can still easily be updated by
taking the next stable tag, reconfiguring the database configuration to point at your existing database, and copying across the
<em>filestore/</em> directory. The upgrade steps can then be followed, with the Mercurial (hg) steps omitted.

== Identifying your version

The version of SEEK you are running is shown at the bottom left, within the footer, when viewing pages in SEEK.

You can also tell which version you have installed by looking at the <em>config/version.yml</em> file, so for example version 0.13.2
looks something like:

  major: 0
  minor: 13
  patch: 2

== General notes about versions and upgrading

<b>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact us.</b> You can find details on how to contact us at: http://seek4science.org/contact

When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to each released minor version in order incrementally (i.e. 0.13.x -> 0.14.x -> 0.15.x -> 0.16.x, you can skip patch versions such as 0.13.3).

Each version has a tag in mercurial, which has the format of <em>v</em> prefix followed by the version - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.2, v0.17.1

<b>When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to 0.13.x)</b> it is necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform
upgrade changes and import any new data. The upgrade task may require an internet connection, and sometimes can take some time to run,
so please be patient. There are instructions for upgrading between each minor version listed below, but they will generally follow the
same pattern. Upgrading to version 0.18 is an exception and involves some additional steps - due to the upgrade of the required versions of Rails and Ruby.

<b>When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.16.0 and 0.16.3)</b> it should
only be necessary to run <em>bundle install</em> and the <em>db:migrate</em> rake task. Using seek:upgrade should still work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time. There is more details and
an example towards the end of the this page.

== Steps to upgrade from 0.20.x to 0.21.x

    export RAILS_ENV=production # if upgrading a production server - remember to set this again if closing and reopening the shell

    bundle exec ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop

#if using rvm do:
    rvm get stable
    rvm install ruby-2.1.3

#then:

    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.21.0
    hg update # only if no other changes have been made to your local version, if you get an error ignore it and do merge
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have, you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    cd .. && cd seek #this is to allow RVM to pick up the ruby and gemset changes
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade

The mechanism to start, stop and restart the delayed-job process has now changed you you should use the rake task seek:workers:<start|stop|restart|status>,
e.g

   bundle exec rake seek:workers:start

there is a new init.d script for this described at https://gist.github.com/e4219ec7cb161129f1c7

== Steps to upgrade from 0.19.x to 0.20.x

Start the upgrade following the standard steps:

    #if using rvm do:
    rvm get stable
    rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p545

    export RAILS_ENV=production # if upgrading a production server - remember to set this again if closing and reopening the shell

    ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.20.0
    hg update # only if no other changes have been made to your local version, if you get an error ignore it and do merge
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have, you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade

If you are upgrading a production server, you also need to run the following task. Be patient, as this can take a few minutes

        bundle exec rake assets:precompile

Now proceed with the rest of the usual tasks:

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start # to restart the search server
    ./script/delayed_job start

    touch tmp/restart.txt
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear


If you are running through Apache, you should also add the following block to your Apache configuration, after the Directory block:

    <LocationMatch "^/assets/.*$">
             Header unset ETag
             FileETag None
             # RFC says only cache for 1 year
             ExpiresActive On
             ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
    </LocationMatch>

so it will look something like:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerName www.yourhost.com
         DocumentRoot /srv/rails/seek/public
            <Directory /srv/rails/seek/public>
             AllowOverride all
             Options -MultiViews
          </Directory>
          <LocationMatch "^/assets/.*$">
             Header unset ETag
             FileETag None
             # RFC says only cache for 1 year
             ExpiresActive On
             ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
          </LocationMatch>
    </VirtualHost>

You may also need to enable a couple of Apache modules, so run:

    sudo a2enmod headers
    sudo a2enmod expires

You will then need to restart Apache

    sudo service apache2 restart

== Steps to upgrade from 0.18.x to 0.19.x

Upgrading follows the standard steps:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.19.1
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

    touch tmp/restart.txt
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production

== Steps to upgrade from 0.17.x to 0.18.x

The changes for Version 0.18 included upgrading Ruby to version 1.9.3 and Rails to version 3.2 - this means the upgrade
process is a little bit more involved that usual. For this reason we have a seperate page detailing this upgrade.

Please visit {Upgrading to 0.18}[[link:doc/UPGRADING-TO-0-18.html] for details of how to do this upgrade.

== Steps to upgrade from 0.16.x to 0.17.x

Upgrading follows the standard steps:

    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop RAILS_ENV=production
    hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.17.1
    hg update
    hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
    hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
    bundle install --deployment
    bundle exec rake seek:upgrade RAILS_ENV=production

    bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start RAILS_ENV=production # to restart the search server
    RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

    touch tmp/restart.txt
    bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
    bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production



== Steps to upgrade between patches (e.g. between 0.16.0 to 0.16.3)

This example shows upgrading from v0.16.0, v0.16.1, or v0.16.2 to v0.16.3 as an example, but the process is the same for upgrading between patch versions unless
otherwise stated. You can upgrade directly from one patch version to another, skipping the intermediate versions (so you can upgrade directly 0.16.0 to 0.16.3 without first having to upgrade to 0.16.1)

  hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.16.3
  hg update
  hg merge # if necessary
  hg commit -m "merged" # if necessary
  bundle install --deployment
  bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job stop
  RAILS_ENV=production ./script/delayed_job start

  touch tmp/restart.txt
  bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear RAILS_ENV=production
  bundle exec rake tmp:clear RAILS_ENV=production


== Earlier upgrade notes
