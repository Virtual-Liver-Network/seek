Hi,

The new user Aaron Spiggle just signed up and indicated that they are a member of the following projects and/or institutions:

"test message"

If you know they are a genuine member of the projects you can manage, please assign him/her to the projects by:
- Go to the users profile at http://localhost/people/2
- Click the 'Person Administration' button
- Here you will see the list of projects and institutions that you are able to assign this person to.

You can also add people to a project from the project page and clicking the 'Administer Project members' button.

If the institution does not exist, you can create the new institution. To do this:
- Go to Institutions tab at http://localhost/institutions
- Click the 'New Institution' button

After the institution has been created successfully, you need to assign it to the project following the steps described above.

If you need to contact the person, their details can be found at: http://localhost/people/2, and their email address is aaron@email.com .
