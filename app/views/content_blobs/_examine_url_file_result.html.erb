    You can either upload this file to <%= app_name %> using this URL, or you can register a link to the file.

    By selecting the option below, a copy of the file will be made. This is recommended, and is equivalent to uploading
    a file from your disk. It also means that should the data behind the URL become unavailable, the data is still
    available from <%= app_name %>.
    However, you should be sure that the copyright on the file allows you to do this.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you do not select the option below <%= app_name %> will store only the URL. In this case, when another user
    selects to download the file then they will simply directed to the URL.
