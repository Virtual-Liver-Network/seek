Hi,

The new user <%= @person.name %> just signed up and indicated that they are a member of the following projects and/or institutions:

"<%= @details %>"

If you know they are a genuine member of the <%= t('project').pluralize.downcase %> you can manage, please assign him/her to the <%= t('project').pluralize.downcase %> by:
- Go to the users profile at <%= person_url(@person, :host=>@host) %>
- Click the 'Person Administration' button
- Here you will see the list of <%= t('project').pluralize.downcase %> and institutions that you are able to assign this person to.

You can also add people to a <%= t('project').downcase %> from the project page and clicking the 'Administer <%= t('project') %> members' button.

If the institution does not exist, you can create the new institution. To do this:
- Go to Institutions tab at <%= institutions_url(:host=>@host) %>
- Click the 'New Institution' button

After the institution has been created successfully, you need to assign it to the <%= t('project').downcase %> following the steps described above.

If you need to contact the person, their details can be found at: <%= person_url(@person, :host=>@host) %>, and their email address is <%= @person.email %> .
